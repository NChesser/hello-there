Social Plan

Hi, I want to improve my social skills and feel more comfortable in social situations. I have identified some key focuses to work on:

Key focuses
- Approach people and starting conversations
- Adding more in social groups and events
- Approaching potential partners and building confidence
- Facing rejection
- Building deeper connections with friends

Develop a set of daily practices that can be done in a gamified relaxed format
